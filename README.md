# Extract Feature Service
This script leverages ArcPy that is part of the ArcGIS Pro to lift and extract a feature service from a map within a Pro project.  Typically this service will be found in ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Portal, but it can be from ArcGIS Server as well.  This script will not download tile or map services.
